# High quality figures in Adobe Illustrator

## Please install Illustrator yourself

Licenses require approval from the person’s reports-to manager, or in the case of graduate students their supervisor. This approval is done through theIT ServiceNow platform, so please follow these steps:
 
1. Go to https://ucalgary.service-now.com/it

2. Login at the top right

3. Click on “Order Something”

4. Click on  “Applications and Software”

5. Click on “Software For Personal and / or Lab computers”

6. Fill in the form:

“What software do you require” enter “Adobe Creative Cloud (includes Acrobat Pro)”

“Do you require an alternate version of the software” enter “No”

“Please describe the type of computer this software will be used in” enter “Single computer (personally owned or university owned)” [note: enter this even if it’s a shared/lab computer, or the license won’t get provisioned correctly]

7. Click “add to cart” at the bottom of the page

8. Click “checkout” on the right of the page.
 
This will then send an approval request to the manager, and once the manager clicks the approval link in the email it will provision a license for the user. Following that it will become available in Software Center (if you use a Windows computer) or Self Service (if you use an Apple computer), or alternatively if you are on a personal/unmanaged computer you can manually download the Adobe Creative Cloud desktop application from the Adobe website and install it on your computer. From within the Creative Cloud Desktop app you can install Illustrator or any other Adobe applications you need/want.
